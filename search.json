From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better research in less time (6) and expand the capacity of modern technical engineering-based skills in research groups. By applying modern operational and project management practices, we will optimize work done across the WPs.

In particular, these aspects are not shared and advertised, so if they exist, others can reuse and learn about something that isn’t shared.

    "text": "Science is increasingly moving into more team-based, multi-centered enterprises, as well as having a greater requirement for openness and reproducibility. These require using modern practices designed for these conditions, rarely seen in academia but common within many industry settings. Our aim with WP1 is to deliver “better, open, and reproducible research done in less time” by employing these practices, as well as providing upskilling opportunities to researchers for skills and knowledge in these practices.\nOur basic strategies will be to establish working groups, including a group dedicated to “research operations” to fulfil this core aim, as well as developing and implementing common practices and tools that maximise collaboration and that follow some guiding principles. All groups will include a “tech lead” who has technical knowledge and skills and who will also be part of the research operations group, to help coordinate WP groups with these practices. We aim to onboard and train the tech leads in these practices by embedding them in some work done at SDCA, where these practices have been developing and refining over the last several years. The most relevant practices and skills that this WP1 aims to provide are in software and data engineering, iterative project management, collaborative workflows and tools,\nPertinent to these practices is understanding and assessing risk and challenges. The two biggest challenges we face with this WP1 are:\n\nThe need for highly technical personnel who have sufficient fundamental expertise to understand and apply these practices, which we hope to minimise through the training and onboarding of the tech leads.\nthe IT systems across centers that often don’t work well together, which we hope to reduce the impact of by having a dedicated research operations group.\n\nWhile this WP1 forms the foundation to all other WPs and in many ways aims to support their success, the activities of WP1 are an increasingly needed aspect of research globally. In this regard, we aim to produce tangible and usable deliverables that are independent and valuable on their own.",

Thus, our general strategy incorporates not only the standard project management activities as well as modern approaches to coordinating tasks and outputs between groups. The general strategies we’ll take are to:\nEstablish an overall management group and a research operations group of relevant persons from each center to track progress, coordinate tasks, and manage the project Develop and agree on some guiding principles for collaboration and work to follow across centers and WPs that adhere to open science practices Investigate and identify resources, limitations, and barriers on cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes Develop and agree on a set of common tools and standards to use across centers for WP to have smoother collaboration and sharing of outputs, that also consider the barriers and resources as well as the guiding principles",

Given that personnel in research environments with the necessary technical knowledge and skills are few and often move out of academia into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we’ve structured the groups to include at least one “tech lead” who is also part of the research ops group is to help minimise this challenge. We aim to provide training to this tech lead by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we’ve decided to establish a research ops group, so that we can minimise the impact these issues have on completing the project deliverables.",

Aside from individual groups for each WP, there will also be a group dedicated to overseeing the research operations. This group will, at a minimum, be composed of at least one person from each WP (and preferably in each center) who acts as a “tech lead” for that WP group. The tech lead should be someone with above average literacy in programming/computing/IT.\n\n\nResearch operations\nThe aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. The research ops group will act as a unit that works to reduce tech barriers, develop software and data engineering processes and tools, and advise on how to best design the outputs of WPs that are the inputs of other WPs. Some of the initial tasks revolve around establishing: a communications channel for everyone (as well as sub-channels for individual WPs and groups) that make it easy to keep everyone updated and to view all communications done (not emails); a project management platform visible and usable by everyone; an effective project management approach that groups can use to track tasks and deliverables (e.g. a suitable approach might be using Kanban principles); and a document sharing platform, ensuring that all of these also follow the guiding principles. Later tasks include developing the deliverables of the WPs in a way that makes sharing and interoperability easier, both internal to the project groups and WPs as well as to external stakeholders.",

    "text": "Why is a new strategy for diabetes prevention necessary?\nWe have known for over two decades that it is possible -in principle- to prevent Type 2 Diabetes in people at very high risk by encouraging them to participate in a very intensive lifestyle modification programme.\n\n\nThe original Diabetes Prevention Studies were conducted around the turn of the century.\n\n\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program (USA)\n\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Study (Finland)\n\n\nThe Da Qing Study (China)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, subsequent efforts to translate the benefits from these efficacy trials into sustainable day to day practice have largely failed. The first main issue is that the resources and intensity of the trial interventions are not practically achievable at large scale. Studies that have applied less intensive lifestyle interventions have generally shown only temporary impacts on weight, but no long-term impact on diabetes incidence. The second main issue is that the particular subgroup of pre-diabetes recruited into the trials (IGT) is the group at highest diabetes risk, but is rarely identified in daily practice especially since HbA1c has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the main diagnostic tool in Europe and the US since 2014.\nIn other words:\n\nThe population with high diabetes risk today is much more heterogeneous compared to the participants in the original prevention trials\nThe intensity of intervention applied in the efficacy trials is not pragmatically or sustainably achievable.\n\n\nWhat has changed since?\nThe past decades have brought a lot of new opportunities for diabetes prevention, which are currently often underutilised:\n\nExtensive, linkable health registers with population-wide coverage\nAdvanced statistical and machine learning methods\nDeeper insight into psychosocial barriers for sustainable health behaviour change\nStronger experience with methods for development of complex interventions\nExpanding evidence for substantial heterogeneity in (pre)diabetes and diabetes risk\nAdvanced technology for real time measurements (CGM, sleep, physical activity)\nWidespread adoption of communication via smartphones and use of apps"
