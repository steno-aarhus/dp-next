The air was filled with the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread and the vibrant colors of stalls displaying an array of fruits and vegetables. Children laughed as they chased each other through the cobblestone streets, creating a joyful symphony that echoed through the charming community.\nMeanwhile, high above the village, fluffy clouds painted the sky in hues of pink and orange as the sun began its descent. A lone eagle soared gracefully, riding the warm currents of air. In the distance, the silhouette of an ancient castle stood tall on a hill, silently witnessing the passage of time. As evening descended, the village transformed into a tranquil oasis, the soft glow of lanterns casting a warm and enchanting ambiance over the cobblestone streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nconfig:\n    themeCSS: \"svg {width: 700px}\"\n    gantt:\n        barHeight: 50\n        leftPadding: 175\n        fontSize: 20\n        sectionFontSize: 20\n        barGap: 10\n---\n\ngantt\n    title Estimated timeline for DP-Next project\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    axisFormat %Y\n    tickInterval 1year\n    todayMarker off\n    %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".)\n\n    section WP1&lt;br&gt;Management&lt;br&gt;and Collaboration\n    Task 1.1 General project management: t1_1, 2025-01-01, 5y\n    Task 1.2 Optimising collaboration: t1_2, 2025-01-01, 5y\n\n    section WP2&lt;br&gt;Risk Prediction\n    Task 2.1 Separate risk prediction model development : t2_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    Task 2.2 Machine Learning approaches for risk prediction : t2_2, 2026-01-01, 18M\n    Task 2.3 Joint risk prediction model development : t2_3, 2026-07-01, 18M\n\n    section WP3&lt;br&gt;Heterogeneity\n    Task 3.1 Advanced clustering models : t3_1, 2027-07-01, 18M\n    Task 3.2 Deep phenotyping substudy : t3_2, 2025-07-01, 54M\n\n    section WP4&lt;br&gt;Development&lt;br&gt;and intervention\n    Task 4.1 Investigate barriers and facilitators : t4_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    Task 4.2 Develop and co-design intervention activities : t4_2, after t4_1, 18M\n\n    section WP5&lt;br&gt;Evaluation&lt;br&gt;of intervention\n    Task 5.1 Validation of risk prediction models : t5_1, 2028-01-01, 18M\n    Task 5.2 Pilot testing of intervention components in specific populations : t5_2, 2028-01-01, 1y\n    Task 5.3 Evaluation of intervention : t5_3, 2028-07-01, 18M"
