From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better research in less time (6) and expand the capacity of modern technical engineering-based skills in research groups across Steno and Denmark. By applying modern operational, engineering, and project management practices, we will optimize work done across the WPs. Through formal and informal upskilling sessions, we will develop data engineering and modern collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers from across the Steno Centers.\nAt SDCA, we have been developing and applying these practices in multiple projects (1–5), which highlight tangible examples of WP1’s activities. The general strategy for WP1 is to: 1) develop and agree on some basic principles for collaboration between centers and WPs that adhere to open scientific practices and modern collaborative methods; 2) investigate potential barriers to effective cross-Steno collaboration; 3) decide on a set of common tools and standards to use across centers for WP. Specific actions and tasks are found in Figure 1 (b) and Figure 1 (d).\nAside from the traditional management group overseeing the project, we will also have a research operations group that will simplify, streamline, and automate the collaboration and coordination of activities and products between WPs and centers as well as provide a space for learning these technical skills. See Figure 1 (c) and the collaboration section below for more details, as well as Figure 1 (a) for the general project timeline.\nA major component of WP1 is also upskilling activities, in collaboration with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project (4). Training will focus on skills not often taught to researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices, and iterative project management methods.\nMore detail on this WP can be found on the DP-Next website (https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dp-next/wp1/), such as the roadmap, potential challenges, and strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {\n  'theme': 'neutral', \n  'gantt': {\n    'barHeight': 25,\n    'leftPadding': 125\n  }\n}}%%\ngantt\n    title Estimated timeline and activities for DP-Next project\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    axisFormat %Y\n    tickInterval 1year\n    todayMarker off\n    %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".)\n\n    section WP1&lt;br&gt;Management&lt;br&gt;and Collaboration\n    T1.1 General project management: t1_1, 2025-01-01, 5y\n    T1.2 Optimising collaboration: t1_2, 2025-01-01, 5y\n\n    section WP2&lt;br&gt;Risk Prediction\n    T2.1 Separate model development: t2_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    T2.2 Machine Learning approaches: t2_2, 2026-01-01, 18M\n    T2.3 Joint model development: t2_3, 2026-07-01, 18M\n    T2.4 Validation: t2_4, 2028-01-01, 18M\n\n    section WP3&lt;br&gt;Heterogeneity\n    T3.1 Advanced clustering models: t3_1, 2027-07-01, 18M\n    T3.2 Deep phenotyping substudy: t3_2, 2025-07-01, 54M\n\n    section WP4&lt;br&gt;Development&lt;br&gt;and intervention\n    T4.1 Investigate barriers and facilitators: t4_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    T4.2 Develop & co-design: t4_2, after t4_1, 18M\n    T4.3 Pilot test in specific populations: t4_3, after t4_2, 1y\n    T4.4 Evaluation: t4_4, 2028-07-01, 18M\n\n\n\n\n(a) General Gantt chart for all of DP-Next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {\n  'theme': 'neutral', \n  'gantt': {\n    'barHeight': 25,\n    'leftPadding': 100\n  }\n}}%%\ngantt\n  title Tasks (T), Milestones (M), and Deliverables (D) for WP1\n  dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n  axisFormat %Y\n  tickInterval 1year\n  todayMarker off\n  %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".)\n\n  section Ongoing&lt;br&gt;activities\n  T4.

The first main issue is that the resources and intensity of the trial interventions are not practically achievable at large scale. Studies that have applied less intensive lifestyle interventions have generally shown only temporary impacts on weight, but no long-term impact on diabetes incidence. The second main issue is that the particular subgroup of pre-diabetes recruited into the trials (IGT) is the group at highest diabetes risk, but is rarely identified in daily practice especially since HbA1c has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the main diagnostic tool in Europe and the US since 2014.\nIn other words:\n\nThe population with high diabetes risk today is much more heterogeneous compared to the participants in the original prevention trials\nThe intensity of intervention applied in the efficacy trials is not pragmatically or sustainably achievable.\n\n\nWhat has changed since?\nThe past decades have brought a lot of new opportunities for diabetes prevention, which are currently often underutilised:\n\nExtensive, linkable health registers with population-wide coverage\nAdvanced statistical and machine learning methods\nDeeper insight into psychosocial barriers for sustainable health behaviour change\nStronger experience with methods for development of complex interventions\nExpanding evidence for substantial heterogeneity in (pre)diabetes and diabetes risk\nAdvanced technology for real time measurements (CGM, sleep, physical activity)\nWidespread adoption of communication via smartphones and use of apps"

The outcome, incident diabetes will be derived from various registers according to the Open Source Diabetes Classifier developed at SDCA, which is extensively documented and updated.\nWe will develop, compare and combine two different approaches: Modular: a traditional statistical approach (Poisson models) applied in parallel within different domains (e.g. GDM/reproductive health, medication history, diagnostic history, socio-economic status), followed by an ensemble model which produces a yearly updated summary risk prediction. Machine Learning (ML): data driven ML methods will be applied to identify informative risk indicators and high-level interactions across all domains, and a risk prediction model will be developed using methods adapted to handle time-to-event data. e.g. survival versions of random forests, XGBoost, DeepCox, DeepHit, Dynamic-DeepHit, MultiSurv. Model interpretability will be an important consideration, in order to quantify the source of the estimated risk both at the population level (HR, variable importance) and at the individual level (SHAP values).\nGreenlandic and Faroese data is clinically more comprehensive than Danish register data, making direct inclusion of EMR data in the development and transfer of model(s) necessary and feasible in these two countries. Diabetes in Greenland has a larger genetic component and differs in other dimensions that may help identify unique risk factors. Performance of the model will be assessed using C-statistics. Internal validation will be performed using bootstrapping and k-fold cross-validation, and/or internal-external cross validation. External validation of the model will be done in similar register data from e.g. Sweden or Scotland. The model will be reported according to the TRIPOD+ AI standards.\nSeveral smaller or larger models can be developed based on data accessibility and practical usability requirements. Models will be integrated into the ongoing SAMBLIK project, which will provide secure cross-sectorial insight into individual-level data across the primary and secondary care sectors, taking in data from municipalities and regions. The ambition is for the WP2 risk model(s) to become an integrated module in the SAMBLIK Diabetes tab, thus giving clinicians direct individual insight into the trajectory of diabetes risk and contributing risk factors. At the group level municipalities will be able to use SAMBLIK for a detailed local socio economic and geographic map of diabetes risk, e.g. for use in WP4 activities.\nRisk groups identified in WP2 will inform the focus and structure of WP4 and will be used as a benchmark to examine the additional benefit of deep phenotyping in WP3."

    "text": "Potential barriers and challenges\nAside from the standard project management tasks, implementing modern research ops and collaborative practices that support conducting open and reproducible science across all Steno Centers will be a challenge. Given that personnel in research environments with the necessary technical knowledge and skills are few and often move out of academia into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we’ve structured the groups to include at least one “tech lead” who is also part of the research ops group is to help minimise this challenge. We aim to provide training to this tech lead by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we’ve decided to establish a research ops group, so that we can minimise the impact these issues have on completing the project deliverables.",

Aside from individual groups for each WP, there will also be a group dedicated to overseeing the research operations. This group will, at a minimum, be composed of at least one person from each WP (and preferably in each center) who acts as a “tech lead” for that WP group. The tech lead should be someone with above average literacy in programming/computing/IT.\n\n\nResearch operations\nThe aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. The research ops group will act as a unit that works to reduce tech barriers, develop software and data engineering processes and tools, and advise on how to best design the outputs of WPs that are the inputs of other WPs. Some of the initial tasks revolve around establishing: a communications channel for everyone (as well as sub-channels for individual WPs and groups) that make it easy to keep everyone updated and to view all communications done (not emails); a project management platform visible and usable by everyone; an effective project management approach that groups can use to track tasks and deliverables (e.g. a suitable approach might be using Kanban principles); and a document sharing platform, ensuring that all of these also follow the guiding principles. Later tasks include developing the deliverables of the WPs in a way that makes sharing and interoperability easier, both internal to the project groups and WPs as well as to external stakeholders.",

    "text": "Science, while generating cutting-edge knowledge, lags behind most industry settings when it comes to practical, operational aspects. For instance, while much of research done now relies heavily on software and computational work, funding agencies rarely fund software and data engineering projects, nor do many research groups hire these highly skilled technical personnel. So, the aim of Work Package 1 is to establish these skills and needs as a core component of this project and to help do “better research in less time”.\nOur basic strategies will be to establish working groups, including a group dedicated to “research operations” to fulfil this core aim, as well as developing and implementing common practices and tools that maximise collaboration and that follow some guiding principles. All groups will include a “tech lead” who has technical knowledge and skills and who will also be part of the research operations group, to help coordinate WP groups with these practices. We aim to onboard and train the tech leads in these practices by embedding them in some work done at SDCA, where these practices have been developing and refining over the last several years. The most relevant practices and skills that this WP1 aims to provide are in software and data engineering, iterative project management, collaborative workflows and tools,\nPertinent to these practices is understanding and assessing risk and challenges. The two biggest challenges we face with this WP1 are:\n\nThe need for highly technical personnel who have sufficient fundamental expertise to understand and apply these practices, which we hope to minimise through the training and onboarding of the tech leads.\nthe IT systems across centers that often don’t work well together, which we hope to reduce the impact of by having a dedicated research operations group.\n\nWhile this WP1 forms the foundation to all other WPs and in many ways aims to support their success, the activities of WP1 are an increasingly needed aspect of research globally. In this regard, we aim to produce tangible and usable deliverables that are independent and valuable on their own.",

    "text": "Science is state of the art in seeking and gaining knowledge, and yet it lags far behind in general operational, organisational, and technological aspects when compared to industry settings. For instance, there are nearly no research software engineers within research groups or institutions, even though software is a foundational component to conducting research in the modern era.\nLikewise, basic modern communication and project management tools are rarely, if ever, used within research environments, even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings. If these things are used by some groups, they are not shared nor advertised through traditional scientific publications, so if they exist, others can’t reuse and learn from each other to improve how we do research.\nScience is also increasingly moving into more team-based, multi-centered enterprises, as well as having a greater requirement for openness and reproducibility. These require using modern practices designed for these conditions, rarely seen in academia but common within many industry settings.\nOur aim with WP1 is to deliver “better, open, and reproducible research done in less time” by employing these practices, as well as providing upskilling opportunities to researchers for skills and knowledge in these practices.\nWe’ve structured and organised Work Package 1 (WP1) based on the increasing need for openness, transparency, and reproducibility in research. WP1 will deliver the day-to-day project and operations management of all the WPs, as well as facilitating the close collaboration and joint development of expertise across all seven Steno Centers.\nTo achieve effective and optimal coordination and management of a complex project like this, we will apply modern and innovative methods in project and operational management practices, as well as applying a software and data engineering structure and perspective both operational aspects as well as to scientific outputs. We will employ resources and tools developed and tested at SDCA in the past years (1–5) to offer a practical framework for sharing knowledge and technical skills across centres, which will deliver “better research done in less time” (6) while following reproducible and open scientific practices.",
