    "text": "Why is a new strategy for diabetes prevention necessary?\nWe have known for over two decades that it is possible italics-in principle- to prevent Type 2 Diabetes in people at very high risk by encouraging them to participate in a very intensive lifestyle modification programme.\n\n\nThe original Diabetes Prevention Studies were conducted around the turn of the century.\n\n\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program (USA)\n\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Study (Finland)\n\n\nThe Da Qing Study (China)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, subsequent efforts to translate the benefits from these efficacy trials into sustainable day to day practice have largely failed. The first main issue is that the resources and intensity of the trial interventions are not practically achievable at large scale. Studies that have applied less intensive lifestyle interventions have generally shown only temporary impacts on weight, but no long-term impact on diabetes incidence. The second main issue is that the particular subgroup of pre-diabetes recruited into the trials (IGT) is the group at highest diabetes risk, but is rarely identified in daily practice especially since HbA1c has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the main diagnostic tool in Europe and the US since 2014.\nIn other words: * The population with high diabetes risk today is much more heterogeneous compared to the participants in the original prevention trials * The intensity of intervention applied in the efficacy trials is not pragmatically or sustainably achievable.\n\nWhat has changed since?\nThe past decades have brought a lot of new opportunities for diabetes prevention, which are currently often underutilised: * Extensive, linkable health registers with population-wide coverage * Advanced statistical and machine learning methods * Deeper insight into psychosocial barriers for sustainable health behaviour change * Stronger experience with methods for development of complex interventions * Expanding evidence for substantial heterogeneity in (pre)diabetes and diabetes risk * Advanced technology for real time measurements (CGM, sleep, physical activity) * Widespread adoption of communication via smartphones and use of apps"
