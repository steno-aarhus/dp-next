    "text": "The vision for WP4 is to develop and feasibility test a new set of interventions based on a participatory system dynamics approach (PSDA) to prevent diabetes in selected high-risk target groups defined in WP2. This approach was chosen over the highly protocolised and expert based approaches applied to diabetes prevention so far with disappointing long-term impact. The interventions will be developed in co-creation with citizens, families, local organisations, councils and health care providers to achieve sustainable diabetes prevention. Implementation will be across selected regions, municipalities and local communities in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands in order to create local and sustainable solutions to prevent type 2 diabetes.\nThe PSDA process combines current evidence on prevention and health promotion, best practice and local insights to achieve new knowledge and create feasible and sustainable solutions/interventions for a complex health challenge such as diabetes prevention29,30. This approach implies that a variety of engagement and solutions may occur at both the interpersonal and organisational levels. Hence, addressing health in a systems approach, rather than at an individual level only, is novel in the sense that it acknowledges that changes in one aspect of the system can have ripple effects throughout the entire system31,32. We hypothesise that developing co-created intervention(s) inspired by psychosocial theories such as motivation, health literacy, social support and social networks and based in the local community setting/family setting, will result in sustainable improvements in behaviour (diet, physical activity, sleep) and wellbeing and thereby prevent development of diabetes in people at high risk (WP2).\nSeveral researchers at SDCA, SDCC and SDCS have substantial experience with PSDA in different settings and target groups in Denmark. Employees from all participating SDCs will receive training in how to apply PSDA to solve complex health challenges regarding diabetes prevention. The target group for the training is regional consultants and employees from the selected local communities (e.g. local communities in a municipality) taking part in the development phase."

    "text": "PSDA process components\n\nStage 1: Preparation phase\nReview of existing evidence and practice regarding diabetes prevention for the specific target group(s) from WP2 and Selection of Regions, municipalities and local communities and identification of key stakeholders.\n\n\nStage 2: Group Model Building and Systems Mapping\nRecruitment of key leaders and local stakeholders: A coordinator from participating SDC/regions and municipalities will together with the research team identify and recruit 12-15 key leaders (e.g. local politicians, department heads, municipality leaders) and local stakeholders (e.g. health care providers, local sport club representatives, religious leaders, NGOs within health and social care etc.). Key leaders and local stakeholders will be selected based on authority and capacity to initiate actions that are likely to prevent diabetes across sectors and organisations.\nGroup Model Building and systems mapping: During this stage, three workshops (WS1, WS2, WS3) will be held in each participating community. WS1 and WS2 will engage the key leaders and stakeholders. Local health profiles (based on data from the target groups found in WP2) will be presented to provide the first critical engagement step. The key leaders and stakeholders will map the system by building a causal loop diagram to understand how the perceived local system affects the diabetes development in their community. In WS3, all community members willing to engage in driving the change in the local system will be invited to identify priority areas for actions based on the causal loop diagram from WS1 and WS2.\n\n\nStage 3: Implementation of actions, support and monitoring\nActions and support: the output of WS3 is the formation of working groups across the sectors that will focus on implementing chosen actions. The working groups will be supported and supervised by a backbone office consisting of the regional and municipal coordinator(s) and the research team. A follow-up workshop (WS4) will be held with the key stakeholders six months after completion of WS3 to review the consolidated priority actions. To increase and maintain motivation and actions across region, municipality and community, subsequent follow-up meetings will be held with the working groups when needed during the follow-up period after WS3. Monitoring: At an annual meeting across region, municipality and community, health data will be presented to action groups, key leaders and stakeholders, to sustain and promote engagement. Evaluation\nWe will assess if the intervention and study procedures (WP4) are feasible by combining qualitative and quantitative data, focusing on practicality, acceptability, fidelity, and limited-effectiveness testing. Combined, these elements will give an essential understanding of what is required to upscale DP-Next to large-scale testing. The evaluation will be guided by recent frameworks33,34 and will be constructed to allow for systematic documentation of processes and tentative outcomes. A final program theory on “what works for whom under what circumstances” based on the participatory systems dynamic approach will be made, including recommendations for large-scale testing. In addition to systems measurements, individual measurements will be collected in order to evaluate the specific actions (specific intervention components), e.g. changes in HbA1c, physical activity, diet patterns, sleep, general well-being, health literacy and social support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Steps in the Participatory System Dynamics Approach."

    "text": "Example of PSDA in a high-risk target group.\nTo concretize the PSDA, the process is described in detail for a known high-risk group: ‘Women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM)’. The same approach will be followed for other identified high-risk groups, ensuring that each group’s unique risks and needs are thoroughly assessed and addressed with the same rigour and systematic methodology.\n\nStage 1:\nMore than 3,500 (6%) pregnant women are annually diagnosed with GDM in Denmark and the number has increased 3-fold in the last decades35. Women with GDM have an increased risk of long-term adverse health outcomes, including impaired glucose tolerance, T2D, and cardiovascular disease. GDM leaves the mother with an 8-10-fold higher risk of T2D, highest within 3-6 years after the GDM pregnancy36,37. A recent Danish study found that almost 21% of women offered a clinical follow-up program, aiming at supporting women with GDM, had developed pre-diabetes, T2D or T1D one year postpartum38. Studies have shown that T2D can be prevented or at least postponed by weight loss, physical activity, and diet3,4,39. A low intensity family based intervention delivered in the first year after delivery in a Danish setting targeting women with prior GDM and their families showed improvements in a number of cardiometabolic risk factors, and was found acceptable and feasible for families and HCP (unpublished data for the FACE-IT study40). Although regular participation in follow-up screening at GP (recommended guidelines) has been shown to increase the likelihood of early detection of prediabetes/T2D, participation is low38. Qualitative research has shown the use of electronic reminders of follow-up screening after GDM to be well received by women, although the interaction with their GP played a significant role41 and that there is remaining need for support from healthcare providers for healthy lifestyle modifications adapted to their situation42. Thus, the follow-up of women with GDM in general practice is not systematic, and hence, prevention of diabetes is suboptimal.\n\n\nStage 2:\nThe PSDA-example builds on this improvement potential by optimising the clinical follow-up in general practice using PSDA. Potential participants in the GMB process and system mapping (WS1-3) could potentially be: GP´s, families where the mother has been diagnosed with GDM, midwives, health visitors, obstetricians, endocrinologists, NGO´s and primary care coordinators.\n\n\nStage 3:\nBased on the system mapping, working groups will be created and actions will start to be developed aiming to increase participation in the clinical follow-up visits at the GP. Thus it could be suggested that women with previous GDM could have a fasting blood glucose and an HbA1c taken postpartum at the 3-months child examination at the GP in order to follow the current Danish guidelines. In addition the woman will be reminded to have an HbA1c taken yearly also in alignment with the current guidelines. Examples of possible actions/interventions could be: To develop and evaluate risk communication strategies for GP´s to women with prior GDM and their families in order to increase continued participation. To enhance systems supporting the data-infrastructure, e.g. by using reminders41 and platforms to access data (e.g. existing systems like SAMBLIK and alike)"

From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better research in less time (6) and expand the capacity of modern technical engineering-based skills in research groups across Steno and Denmark. By applying modern operational, engineering, and project management practices, we will optimize work done across the WPs. Through formal and informal upskilling sessions, we will develop data engineering and modern collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers from across the Steno Centers.\nAt SDCA, we have been developing and applying these practices in multiple projects (1–5), which highlight tangible examples of WP1’s activities. The general strategy for WP1 is to: 1) develop and agree on some basic principles for collaboration between centers and WPs that adhere to open scientific practices and modern collaborative methods; 2) investigate potential barriers to effective cross-Steno collaboration; 3) decide on a set of common tools and standards to use across centers for WP. Specific actions and tasks are found in Figure 1 (b) and Figure 1 (d).\nAside from the traditional management group overseeing the project, we will also have a research operations group that will simplify, streamline, and automate the collaboration and coordination of activities and products between WPs and centers as well as provide a space for learning these technical skills. See Figure 1 (c) and the collaboration section below for more details, as well as Figure 1 (a) for the general project timeline.\nA major component of WP1 is also upskilling activities, in collaboration with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project (4). Training will focus on skills not often taught to researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices, and iterative project management methods.\nMore detail on this WP can be found on the DP-Next website (https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dp-next/wp1/), such as the roadmap, potential challenges, and strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {\n  'theme': 'neutral', \n  'gantt': {\n    'barHeight': 25,\n    'leftPadding': 125\n  }\n}}%%\ngantt\n    title Estimated timeline and activities for DP-Next project\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    axisFormat %Y\n    tickInterval 1year\n    todayMarker off\n    %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".)\n\n    section WP1&lt;br&gt;Management&lt;br&gt;and Collaboration\n    T1.1 General project management: t1_1, 2025-01-01, 5y\n    T1.2 Optimising collaboration: t1_2, 2025-01-01, 5y\n\n    section WP2&lt;br&gt;Risk Prediction\n    T2.1 Separate model development: t2_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    T2.2 Machine Learning approaches: t2_2, 2026-01-01, 18M\n    T2.3 Joint model development: t2_3, 2026-07-01, 18M\n    T2.4 Validation: t2_4, 2028-01-01, 18M\n\n    section WP3&lt;br&gt;Heterogeneity\n    T3.1 Advanced clustering models: t3_1, 2027-07-01, 18M\n    T3.2 Deep phenotyping substudy: t3_2, 2025-07-01, 54M\n\n    section WP4&lt;br&gt;Development&lt;br&gt;and intervention\n    T4.1 Investigate barriers and facilitators: t4_1, 2025-01-01, 18M\n    T4.2 Develop & co-design: t4_2, after t4_1, 18M\n    T4.3 Pilot test in specific populations: t4_3, after t4_2, 1y\n    T4.4 Evaluation: t4_4, 2028-07-01, 18M\n\n\n\n\n(a) General Gantt chart for all of DP-Next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {\n  'theme': 'neutral', \n  'gantt': {\n    'barHeight': 25,\n    'leftPadding': 100\n  }\n}}%%\ngantt\n  title Tasks (T), Milestones (M), and Deliverables (D) for WP1\n  dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n  axisFormat %Y\n  tickInterval 1year\n  todayMarker off\n  %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".)\n\n  section Ongoing&lt;br&gt;activities\n  T4.

Both cohorts recruited participants more than a decade ago and examined a wide set of cardiometabolic and genetic risk factors, health behaviours and biomarkers, including fat distribution measures and physical activity measures from week long combined heart rate/accelerometer readings. We will link these cohorts to the register-based risk predictions from WP2 (backdated to each cohort baseline), and examine the added predictive value of individual biological risk indicators and of risk factor clusters.

    "text": "WP 3.2 Deep Phenotyping of HbA1c defined pre-diabetes\n\nHypothesis: Among individuals with routinely identified prediabetes based on HbA1c, deep phenotyping with non-invasive methods will identify subgroups at the highest risk of progression to T2D and subgroups likely to maintain prediabetes or achieve remission; beyond the predictive ability of age, sex, HbA1c and BMI.\n\n\nBackground:\nAlthough elevated blood glucose precedes T2D onset by over a decade14, many people with slightly elevated HbA1c do not progress to diabetes15. Depending on the criteria for prediabetes, 10-40% develop T2D within 1-5 years16–18 and 17-45% revert to normoglycaemia15, pointing to significant heterogeneity in diabetes risk among individuals with prediabetes19–21. A relatively recent cluster-driven diabetes subclassification delineated two subgroups with relatively young age of diabetes onset and absence of marked obesity and low insulin secretion22, which map to genetic, metabolic and phenotypic characteristics already present in pre-diabetes. Notably, a recent study identified elevated liver fat and diminished beta-cell function as the most predictive factors for progressing to T2D in people with pre-diabetes23, highlighting the need to extend precision approaches for diabetes prevention beyond genetic predisposition and insulin resistance. The current vision for precision prevention integrates data from genetic, biological (multi-omic), health behavioural and psycho-social components; however, few cohorts have these data in a contemporary population defined in a clinical context.\n\n\nStrategic Vision:\nWP3 establishes such a cohort across Steno Centers with long-term academic and strategic visions. The strategic vision is to establish the facilities, expertise and capacity across all Steno Centers to carry out multi-center clinical studies with a standardised protocol and management/data infrastructure. We also want to prepare the centers for the standardised application of deep phenotyping close to clinical practice by applying a high degree of standardisation, openness and reproducibility (WP1).\n\n\nAcademic Objectives:\nAcademically, we describe a core protocol, which will be carried out within the DP-Next budget and timeframe, and an extended protocol, which describes our ambitions for deeper phenotyping and longer follow-up. Funding for the extended protocol will be sought separately on a project basis and will build on the capacity established in the core protocol. Connection and coordination will be sought with new Danish phenotyping initiatives currently underway or in the planning process (e.g. PRECiSE).\n\n\nWho will be included:\nIn the core protocol we will identify a cohort of 1000 individuals aged 40 to 55 years who have recently (within the past 12 months) had a routine HbA1c measurement in the pre-diabetic range (42-47 mmol/mol) and are not using any glucose lowering medication. This age range was chosen to maximise life-long impact on diabetes risk. Sample size calculations use our recent analysis of HbA1c defined (pre)diabetes in Denmark1, showing that 25 to 40% of Danish residents aged 40-55 had at least 1 HbA1c measurement in 2018. In our target age range pre-diabetes incidence was 9/1000 person years, and the subsequent incidence of diabetes was 7/1000, and hence an expected cumulative T2D incidence of 22% in a median of 3.5 years of follow-up. Logistic regression based power calculations show that a cohort of 1050 individuals gives us 0.9 power at a 0.05 significance level to detect an odds ratio of at least 1.28 per standard deviation in a continuous exposure variable.\n\n\nRecruitment:\nParticipants will be recruited in Odense (350), Aarhus (350), Aalborg (150), Greenland (50) and the Faroe Islands (50). We intend to include 100 individuals of Greenlandic ancestry, 50 living in Denmark and 50 living in Greenland. Participants will be recruited based on data from routine HbA1c checks, accessed through the LABKA registers. Consequently the clinical decisions prompting a HbA1c measurement will form part of the selection process, reflecting current clinical practice.\n\n\nCore Protocol:\nParticipants will be invited to answer an online questionnaire (medical and family history, sociodemographic data, health literacy, food habits and cravings , personality traits such as willingness to take risks, quality of life, self-perceived mental stress, depression, anxiety, sleep apnea scores) followed by a 4-hour clinical examination at one of the Steno Diabetes Centers. The programme includes: anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist-hip ratio, and DEXA-scan for body composition), a 5-point oral glucose tolerance test to estimate insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, liver elastography to estimate liver fat and liver stiffness, blood pressure, heart rate variability and pulse-wave velocity for arterial stiffness estimation. Participants will measure physical activity with a combined heart rate monitor / accelerometer during 7 days following the visit. Blood samples will be analysed for lipids and HbA1c and processed for biobanking of plasma, serum and DNA. The biobank will further include urine, saliva and faeces samples. All further measurements will be in biobank samples as part of the extended protocol.\nThe primary outcome for the core protocol is incident Type 2 Diabetes. The LABKA register will identify incident T2D (based on routine HbA1c) supplemented with a study HbA1c measurement at the end of the DP-Next project. The primary statistical analysis will use unsupervised Latent Class Analysis28 to map the heterogeneity across all measured variables. LCA will be carried out at two levels: a full model including all available data and a minimal model using as few data as possible with limited loss of strength. Modelling studies show that our sample of 1000 is sufficient to identify patterns and clusters in most data sets.\n\n\nExtended Protocol:\nOur ambition is to extend the WP3 protocol beyond the budget and time of DP-Next. Additional funding will be sought to expand the depth of the cardiometabolic phenotyping under real life settings, including a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, cardiorespiratory monitoring, and continuous glucose monitoring, with simultaneous app-based diet diaries. We further have the ambition to invite a subset of ~300 participants for a second examination with optical coherence tomography to detect early retinal changes, a single breath-hold MR scan of the liver, and an OGTT during short-term oral steroid treatment. We intend to expand the project carrying out a comprehensive set of omics analyses in biobank materials, including genotyping, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomic characterisation of faeces and saliva as well as a set of targeted biomarkers covering mechanisms such as endothelial function, liver function and auto-immunity (GAD and islet cell antibodies). Our ambition is to extend the follow-up beyond the DP-Next project period, extending the accrual not only of diabetes cases but also of secondary endpoints such as cardiovascular events."

The first main issue is that the resources and intensity of the trial interventions are not practically achievable at large scale. Studies that have applied less intensive lifestyle interventions have generally shown only temporary impacts on weight, but no long-term impact on diabetes incidence. The second main issue is that the particular subgroup of pre-diabetes recruited into the trials (IGT) is the group at highest diabetes risk, but is rarely identified in daily practice especially since HbA1c has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the main diagnostic tool in Europe and the US since 2014.\nIn other words:\n\nThe population with high diabetes risk today is much more heterogeneous compared to the participants in the original prevention trials\nThe intensity of intervention applied in the efficacy trials is not pragmatically or sustainably achievable.\n\n\nWhat has changed since?\nThe past decades have brought a lot of new opportunities for diabetes prevention, which are currently often underutilised:\n\nExtensive, linkable health registers with population-wide coverage\nAdvanced statistical and machine learning methods\nDeeper insight into psychosocial barriers for sustainable health behaviour change\nStronger experience with methods for development of complex interventions\nExpanding evidence for substantial heterogeneity in (pre)diabetes and diabetes risk\nAdvanced technology for real time measurements (CGM, sleep, physical activity)\nWidespread adoption of communication via smartphones and use of apps"

The outcome, incident diabetes will be derived from various registers according to the Open Source Diabetes Classifier developed at SDCA, which is extensively documented and updated.\nWe will develop, compare and combine two different approaches: Modular: a traditional statistical approach (Poisson models) applied in parallel within different domains (e.g. GDM/reproductive health, medication history, diagnostic history, socio-economic status), followed by an ensemble model which produces a yearly updated summary risk prediction. Machine Learning (ML): data driven ML methods will be applied to identify informative risk indicators and high-level interactions across all domains, and a risk prediction model will be developed using methods adapted to handle time-to-event data. e.g. survival versions of random forests, XGBoost, DeepCox, DeepHit, Dynamic-DeepHit, MultiSurv. Model interpretability will be an important consideration, in order to quantify the source of the estimated risk both at the population level (HR, variable importance) and at the individual level (SHAP values).\nGreenlandic and Faroese data is clinically more comprehensive than Danish register data, making direct inclusion of EMR data in the development and transfer of model(s) necessary and feasible in these two countries. Diabetes in Greenland has a larger genetic component and differs in other dimensions that may help identify unique risk factors. Performance of the model will be assessed using C-statistics. Internal validation will be performed using bootstrapping and k-fold cross-validation, and/or internal-external cross validation. External validation of the model will be done in similar register data from e.g. Sweden or Scotland. The model will be reported according to the TRIPOD+ AI standards.\nSeveral smaller or larger models can be developed based on data accessibility and practical usability requirements. Models will be integrated into the ongoing SAMBLIK project, which will provide secure cross-sectorial insight into individual-level data across the primary and secondary care sectors, taking in data from municipalities and regions. The ambition is for the WP2 risk model(s) to become an integrated module in the SAMBLIK Diabetes tab, thus giving clinicians direct individual insight into the trajectory of diabetes risk and contributing risk factors. At the group level municipalities will be able to use SAMBLIK for a detailed local socio economic and geographic map of diabetes risk, e.g. for use in WP4 activities.\nRisk groups identified in WP2 will inform the focus and structure of WP4 and will be used as a benchmark to examine the additional benefit of deep phenotyping in WP3."

We aim to provide training to this tech lead by embedding them in some of the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing many of these practices.\nAnother major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed for cross-institution collaboration.

So, the aim of Work Package 1 is to establish these skills and needs as a core component of this project and to help do “better research in less time”.\nOur basic strategies will be to establish working groups, including a group dedicated to “research operations” to fulfil this core aim, as well as developing and implementing common practices and tools that maximise collaboration and that follow some guiding principles. All groups will include a “tech lead” who has technical knowledge and skills and who will also be part of the research operations group, to help coordinate WP groups with these practices. We aim to onboard and train the tech leads in these practices by embedding them in some work done at SDCA, where these practices have been developing and refining over the last several years. The most relevant practices and skills that this WP1 aims to provide are in software and data engineering, iterative project management, collaborative workflows and tools,\nPertinent to these practices is understanding and assessing risk and challenges. The two biggest challenges we face with this WP1 are:\n\nThe need for highly technical personnel who have sufficient fundamental expertise to understand and apply these practices, which we hope to minimise through the training and onboarding of the tech leads.\nthe IT systems across centers that often don’t work well together, which we hope to reduce the impact of by having a dedicated research operations group.\n\nWhile this WP1 forms the foundation to all other WPs and in many ways aims to support their success, the activities of WP1 are an increasingly needed aspect of research globally.

For instance, there are nearly no research software engineers within research groups or institutions, even though software is a foundational component to conducting research in the modern era.\nLikewise, basic modern communication and project management tools are rarely, if ever, used within research environments, even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings. If these things are used by some groups, they are not shared nor advertised through traditional scientific publications, so if they exist, others can’t reuse and learn from each other to improve how we do research.\nScience is also increasingly moving into more team-based, multi-centered enterprises, as well as having a greater requirement for openness and reproducibility. These require using modern practices designed for these conditions, rarely seen in academia but common within many industry settings.\nOur aim with WP1 is to deliver “better, open, and reproducible research done in less time” by employing these practices, as well as providing upskilling opportunities to researchers for skills and knowledge in these practices.\nWe’ve structured and organised Work Package 1 (WP1) based on the increasing need for openness, transparency, and reproducibility in research.
