## First round

-   **Characters**: 644

WP1 answers the increasing need for openness, transparency, and
reproducibility in research, will deliver the day-to-day project and
operations management of all the WPs and will facilitate close
collaboration and joint expertise development across all Steno Centres.

Effective coordination and management of complex projects such as
DP-Next requires modern and innovative approaches to project and
operational management. We will employ tools developed and tested at
SDCA in the past years [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github] to offer a practical framework for sharing knowledge and
technical skills across centres, aiming to deliver "better research done
in less time" [@Lowndes2017].
