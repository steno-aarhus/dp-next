title: "Strategy"
description: Strategic principles and practical details for WP1.

Traditional management of larger scale research projects often involves
setting up steering committees who check on progress through status
updates and discuss solutions to issues that arise. However, there are
many modern tools and methods used within industry that research
environments and projects could benefit from, such as data engineering,
software development, and operations management. Thus, our general
strategy incorporates not only the standard project management
activities as well as modern approaches to coordinating tasks and
outputs between groups. The general strategies we’ll take are to:

-   Establish an overall management group and a research operations
    group of relevant persons from each center to track progress,
    coordinate tasks, and manage the project.
-   Develop and agree on some guiding principles for collaboration and
    work to follow across centers and WPs that adhere to open science
    practices.
-   Investigate and identify resources, limitations, and barriers on
    cross-Steno collaboration practices and processes.
-   Develop and agree on a set of common tools and standards to use
    across centers for WP to have smoother collaboration and sharing of
    outputs, that also consider the barriers and resources as well as
    the guiding principles.

## Guiding principles

One of the initial steps in the strategy involves developing and
implementing general principles that will guide collaboration and work
across the Steno Centers. This ensures we have a basis for following a
common approach to working and communicating together when managing the
WPs. While we will finalise and refine the principles during the first
year of the project, below are some principles that will form the basis
for all other principles.

-   Assume openness with as many things as possible, including
    communication
-   Implement openness as much as possible, excluding personal and
    sensitive data
-   Disseminate as many steps of the research lifecycle as possible,
    including non-traditional outputs (e.g. protocols or standard
    operating procedures)
-   Implement as much as possible explicit analyses and data
    processing/management using code-based and programmatic
    pipeline/workflow management

## Actions

## Potential tools and methods to use

The exact tools and methods that will be used will first need to be
decided upon by everyone. However, some of the tools and methods that we
are considering that follow the principles include:

-   R for programming, data processing, and analysis
-   GitHub to use as the knowledge repository
-   Quarto (next generation of R Markdown) for writing and sharing
    documents, as well as creating websites
-   Slack/Teams/Discord for central communication
-   GitHub Projects for project management
-   Agile (e.g. Scrum and Kanban) inspired iterative and incremental
    methods for project management
-   Seedcase software for data management and sharing

## Potential barriers and challenges

Aside from the standard project management tasks, implementing modern
research ops and collaborative practices that support conducting open
and reproducible science across all Steno Centers will be a challenge.
Given that personnel in research environments with the necessary
technical knowledge and skills are few and often move out of academia
into industry positions, a substantial amount of time and effort will be
spent in training and upskilling existing personnel. The reason we’ve
structured the groups to include at least one “tech lead” who is also
part of the research ops group is to help minimise this challenge. We
aim to provide training to this tech lead by embedding them in some of
the work we are doing at Steno Aarhus, where we have been implementing
many of these practices.

Another major challenge will be coordinating tasks and work between IT
systems that often don’t work well together or are suboptimally designed
for cross-institution collaboration. This is one reason we’ve decided to
establish a research ops group, so that we can minimise the impact these
issues have on completing the project deliverables.

## People and groups

### Management group

The project will be led by the PI, with support from the co-applicants /
Work Package leaders, who together form the management group. Aside from
individual groups for each WP, there will also be a group dedicated to
overseeing the research operations. This group will, at a minimum, be
composed of at least one person from each WP (and preferably in each
center) who acts as a “tech lead” for that WP group. The tech lead
should be someone with above average literacy in
programming/computing/IT.

### Research operations

The aim of research operations is to optimise day-to-day work in order
to minimise time and effort spent per unit of output. The research ops
group will act as a unit that works to reduce tech barriers, develop
software and data engineering processes and tools, and advise on how to
best design the outputs of WPs that are the inputs of other WPs. Some of
the initial tasks revolve around establishing: a communications channel
for everyone (as well as sub-channels for individual WPs and groups)
that make it easy to keep everyone updated and to view all
communications done (not emails); a project management platform visible
and usable by everyone; an effective project management approach that
groups can use to track tasks and deliverables (e.g. a suitable approach
might be using Kanban principles); and a document sharing platform,
ensuring that all of these also follow the guiding principles. Later
tasks include developing the deliverables of the WPs in a way that makes
sharing and interoperability easier, both internal to the project groups
and WPs as well as to external stakeholders.
